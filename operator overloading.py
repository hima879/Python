# Define a class called Box to represent a real-world storage box

# Now let's use the Box class

# Create a box owned by Alex with some items
alex_box = Box("Alex", ["books", "shoes"])

# Create a box owned by Maya with her items
maya_box = Box("Maya", ["toys", "clothes"])

# Combine both boxes using the overloaded '+' operator
# This creates a new box with both owners and all items
shared_box = alex_box + maya_box

# Print details of each box

# Prints: ðŸ“¦ Box for Alex contains: ['books', 'shoes']
print(alex_box)

# Prints: ðŸ“¦ Box for Maya contains: ['toys', 'clothes']
print(maya_box)

# Prints: ðŸ“¦ Box for Alex & Maya contains: ['books', 'shoes', 'toys', 'clothes']
# This is the result of operator overloading
